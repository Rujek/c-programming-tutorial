This program uses a two-dimensional array of strings to store the names.
The first dimension represents the group number, while the second dimension represents the position of the name within the group.
The program reads names from the user until either the maximum number of groups or the letter 'q' is entered.
Then it prints out the groups of names in the format "name1, name2, name3".
